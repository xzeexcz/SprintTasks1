              They said "Khabib is too hittable, he walks straight into shots
              with his chin in the air, Michael Johnson is going to catch him".
              Khabib then spent 15 min chatting with Dana White while giving
              Johnson the worst beating of his life.
            </p>
            <p>
              They then said "Khabib is too hittable, he walks straight into
              shots with his chin in the air, Edson Barboza is going to catch
              him". Barboza got outstruck on the feet and lost 10 years of life
              expectancy on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now they're saying "Khabib is too hittable, he walks straight into
              shots with his chin in the air, Conor McGregor is going to catch
              him". Yeah sure, the guy who trains in some macdojo in Ireland,
              who went 0-1 against Artemij Sitenkov, 0-1 against Joseph Duffy
              and 1-1 against Nate Diaz is absolutely going to do that. Most of
              them are probably not even Conor fans, they're just desperate
              Khabib haters who can't stand the idea of an undefeated champion
              dominating all their favorite fighters one by one. Expect them to
              become Tony Ferguson fans after UFC 229.

            Manchester City paid the price for failing to make the most of their
            first-half dominance as they were held to a draw by RB Leipzig in
            the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.

          <p>
            Victory at the 2022 Arnold Clark Cup gave England a taste for
            success - but this year's edition felt more like a box ticked with
            greater ambitions in mind.
